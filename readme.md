# AutoRiaCloneApp

My AutoRia Clone App is an API which built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB (Mongoose). This project will help to evaluate my skills in working with these technologies. 

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anton-moskalenko-kh/autoria_nodejs.git
    ```

2. Install all necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Create `.env` file in the root directory. Necessary variables for project you will find in .env example file. Replace data in empty variables for your own or contact with me.
   

4. Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm run start:dev
   ```

   The server will be running at `http://localhost:3001`.
